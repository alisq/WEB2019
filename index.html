    	Description
Learn how to weave a range of online technologies into engaging interactive experiences. In this course, students will learn the basics of web technologies that are fundamental to building an online presence for any design project. Students will learn how to identify the current technologies underlying social media interfaces, mobile web applications that rely on browsers and apps. You will also gain an understanding of the fundamentals of markup languages (HTML, XML) as well as formatting (CSS) and client-side programming (JS). These basic skills will be contextualized within a basic overview of interface design. With the knowledge built in this course students will begin to understand how to create responsive web-based projects that adapt to different devices and develop strategies for creating screen-based interfaces. Students with credit in GDEX-3B13 may not take this course for credit.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Demonstrate an understanding of the appropriate use of web technologies.
Apply the current standard in web formatting and programming.
Integrate technologies from a variety of web-services.
Plan and execute the design of a basic web-based application.
Required Readings
Frank Chimero - What Screens Want 
Johanna Drucker - Graphesis 
Olia Lialina - Turing Complete User 
Lev Manovitch - Database as Symbolic Form

Supplies
Make sure you bring your laptop to every class. It must have the following programs:

Sublime Text (or equivalent text-editing program) 
Chrome (or another developer oriented browser) 
Github Desktop

Student Preparation / Workload Expectations
You can anticipate that studying and completing class will require at a minimum 2–3 hours of time outside of class per week for every hour of in class time per week.

Teaching & Learning Methods
Studio work, seminars and lectures provide the foundation of this course. Students are expected to work on short, bi-weekly workshop assignments, and a larger, multi-week assignment.

Students are expected to arrive in class having read/watched/listened to all of the assigned texts. With assigned texts, all responses must be uploaded before class on the due date. Be prepared to talk about them on that day.

This course will be a balance of coding, form, concept and theory. Individual, small-group and class-wide critiques will take place on a weekly basis. Students are expected to provide input and support on their peers work.

Class Schedule
OCAD U has a twelve-class semester followed by a two-week assessment period for exams and critiques. Students must be available for the duration of this period.

Critique / Exam Schedule
The Final Exam Schedule will be released by the office of the Registrar a few weeks after classes have started. This schedule will be sent to instructors and posted online on the OCAD U website.

Please also refer to Senate Policy, 1019: Examinations. This policy outlines the conditions under which a student may request a) a deferred examination and b) access to final examination materials.

Conflict exams must be reported to the Office of the Registrar within 15 working days after the Final Exam Schedule has been published. All requests for Deferred Final Exams due to medically documented and emergency issues must be requested through the Office of the Registrar. If you have a conflict between a critique and a scheduled exam, please contact your Faculty Office.

Assignments, Critiques and Exams
No assignments have been added.

Late Work
Late work is itself not a moral failure. However this course builds on your skillset and facility from week to week. Falling behind makes it harder to stay on track.

Participation
articipation accounts for 10% of your final mark and includes some or all of the following:

arriving on time and listening to lectures and instruction 
being prepared and working in class time (printed and trimmed work) 
sharing ideas, concepts and creative exploration 
sharing conceptual development in progress with other students 
cooperating in group projects 
analyzing and offering opinions about work in progress 
listening to and being an active participant in critique discussions.

Grading Breakdown
Numerical grades may be translated into letter grades based upon the following scale:

Exceptional
90–100% A+

Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is a shared responsibility. All members of the OCAD University community are required to abide by the academic misconduct policy, breaches of which are considered a very serious offense.

Other examples of academic misconduct include misuse of written or visual sources (“unintentional plagiarism”), cheating during an examination or test, collaborating on assignments without permission, and submitting any work for evaluation that has previously been submitted in another course without prior approval. Read the Academic Misconduct policy to ensure you are well informed.
